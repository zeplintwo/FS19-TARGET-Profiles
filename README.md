# FS19-TARGET-Profiles
Target profiles for usage in Farming Simulator 19. Initial keymaps based on FDR's Logging maps from https://www.fdrlogging.com/. Will be used to bring more advanced controls to T16000.m dual sticks in FS19.

FDR Branch: https://github.com/zeplintwo/FS19-TARGET-Profiles/tree/FDR-Base-profle

Zeplin SCRIPT Branch: https://github.com/zeplintwo/FS19-TARGET-Profiles/tree/Zeplin-SCRIPT

Master branch for Thrustmaster TARGET GUI profile updates and distribution. This will be the most basic of scripting and very little in the way of extra functionality. 

FDR Branch is the direct layout a best as I can build that follows FDR’s key binding. This may have higher scripting functions in the future based off functions form the ‘Zeplin SCRIPT’ Branch.

Zeplin SCRIPT Branch will have as much advanced TARGET scripting as I see fit. And will not hesitate to incorporate 3rd part/external sources if said sources are willing to allow usage of said scripts.
